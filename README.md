Implemented a Flood Fill algorithm, a pivotal cornerstone for optimizing color propagation within the game. This algorithm allows players to seamlessly flood interconnected cells with matching colors, a fundamental aspect of the game's strategic dynamics.

In parallel, I designed a highly adaptable user interface, transcending aesthetics to deliver a truly immersive player experience. The interface's adaptability ensures not only visual cohesion but also seamless interaction, fostering accessibility and engagement. 

To elevate the gaming experience further, I introduced a timer feature, adding a competitive and strategic dimension to the gameplay, and challenging players to act swiftly. I also implemented a move tracker and a maximum move count system which introduces an additional layer of strategy and difficulty, demanding critical thinking within a constrained set of moves.
